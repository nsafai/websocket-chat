## Ideas for enhancements
- Implementing a private message system.
- Using Socket.io's "channels" for multiple make chat teams to exist
- Using Socket.io's "rooms" to make themed chat rooms inside a channel, like "general" and "random"
- Dropping the client into an Electron app to make a desktop app.
- Adding a Team and a User resource and persisting teams and authenticating users.
- Great article on Socket.io's strengths and weaknesses
