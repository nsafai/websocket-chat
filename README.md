# Web Chat client using socket.io
This single page web app is a chat client. It is a learning project as part of Make School's BEW 2.1 Advanced Web Patterns class, inspired from [this tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/standalone/make-chat/)

## Milestones
- [x] Upon entering the application, I can choose a username to go by.
- [x] I can enter a message that shows up on all clients.
- [x] I can join / create chat channels.
- [x] I will never have to refresh the page to receive new messages.
- [x] Polish the web app
- [ ] Ship to Heroku

## Ideas for enhancements
- Implementing a private message system.
- Using Socket.io's "channels" for multiple make chat teams to exist
- Using Socket.io's "rooms" to make themed chat rooms inside a channel, like "general" and "random"
- Dropping the client into an Electron app to make a desktop app.
- Adding a Team and a User resource and persisting teams and authenticating users.
- Great article on Socket.io's strengths and weaknesses
